# sqlalchemy-challenge
# This assignment consists of two portions: one used in Jupyter Notebook using SQLAlchemy, and the other
# using Visual Studio Code with Flask.

# The database consisted of data collected at several locations on Hawaii, with information consisting of 
# rainfall, temperature, location code, etc.

# The database had two tables: a table of each recording the day's rainfall, temperature, and location. 
# The other table had more information on the location, such as lat, long, and elevation.
# Both tables were linked by their location code.

# Through Jupyter Notebook, coding was used to obtain basic data aggregation: max rainfall, min rainfall,
# temperature averages, the most active location.

# Through Flask, much of the same data was simply reported on several routes online.
# This made the data available by using the local computer as the server.
